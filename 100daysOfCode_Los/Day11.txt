Continued building off my pong game. What I did:

* Added a speed multiplier to the ball. 

* Added the ability to pass along player names. 

* Added randomization of ball projectory at start of each round.

Points of pain:

* Still can't properly containerize the game due to an issue with tkinter/screen access in Docker

* Starting to think containerizing anything that isn't vanilla Python isn't worth it
