Continued Learn Bash The Hard Way. What I learned:

* Two different ways to write a For loop: using C notation ( `for (( i=0; i < 20; i++ ))`) or using "in" ( `for f in $(ls *txt)` )

* While loops exist and work like you'd expect them to

* In case statements, double ; indicates when another case is being made (e.g. `1) echo 'a is 1'; echo 'ok';; 2) echo 'a is 2'; echo 'ok';;` )

* getopts is used ofyen in cases
