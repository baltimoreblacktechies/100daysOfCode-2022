Continued Learn Bash The Hard Way to cover functions. What I learned:

* Learned about the channels Std Error and Std Output

* If you string cmds (e.g. `cat file | grep -c file`), if the first cmd outputs to Std Err, nothing is passed to the pipe cmd in this case

* /dev/null is a special file created by Linux (and UNIX) kernels that's black hole into which data can be pumped; anything written to it will be absorbed and ignored.

* The < operator redirects standard input to the command from a file e.g.
`grep -c file < file1` will pass file1 as input to the cmd grep

* Using `>` will overwrite a file; using `>>` will append to it e.g.
echo line2 > file3
echo line3 >> file3 --> cat file3
file3
|
|
--> line2
    line3
