This is just a repository for members of BBT to share some of their projects, efforts and notes. Let's see if we can get 100 days of code together! FAQ: What Is The #100daysOfCode Challenge? 100 Days Of Code is a social media project, primarily on Twitter, that anyone can participate in via the #100daysOfCode hashtag. Developer Alex Kallaway started it in 2016 based on the idea that consistency is the path to mastery. Plus, the hashtag fosters a sense of community\u2014you can use it to see where others are at in their journey and to stay motivated to document your own. How Can I Participate? Do #100daysOfCode with the Baltimore Black Techies! Work your way through projects, or document your Tech journey\u2014either way, posting what you\u2019re learning each day is a great way to see your coding progress unfold and find support. We\u2019ll support you with encouraging messages along the way, and you\u2019ll have the entire <organization> online community to supplement your interactions. At the end of your 100 days coding with us, you\u2019ll get a host of experience and several friends that have taken part in this challenge. Two Main Rules Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days. Slack your progress every day with the Slack channel.

Worked on the next chapter of Learn Bash The Hard Way. What I learned: You don't need quotes to declare a string var: e.g. MYSTRING=astring echo $MYSTRING --> astring Single quotes for vars means you don't actually call the var: e.g. MYSENTENCE='A sentence with MYSTRING in it' echo MYSENTENCE --> A sentence with $MYSTRING in it This is not true for globs ( ): e.g. MYGLOB=\" \" echo $MYGLOB --> Everything in my current directory When indexing arrays: I need curly brackets around the whole variable and index But the still goes outside of the whole declaration: e.g. {BASH_VERSINFO[0]} All simple vars in bash are really arrays with just 1 element in it Commas are one way to iterate through an array: e.g. echo ${BASH_VERSINFO[0,5]} --> x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (returns elements 0-5) Associative arrays are like dicts but look very messy; should prob avoid them Continued Learn Bash The Hard Way to cover functions. What I learned: vars have a global scope unless otherwise declared to declare limited scope, use \"local\": e.g. function myfunc { local myvar=\"Hi from inside the function\" echo myvar } --> if I call myvar outside the function, it won't work because it only exists inside the function \u201c cd - \u201d returns you to the previous directory you were in use \"builtin\" to call functions built into Bash Useful incase you make a function that conflicts in name with a builtin (like \"func cd()\") With clashes, the function, not builtin is used Use \"unset -f name_of_func\" to unset func name & remove the conflict (or \"-v\" to unset vars) \"declare -f\" outputs all funcs in my env (including their code) while \"declare -F\" just lists the funcs names Programs are executable files (think grep, vi, sed, etc) you can use \"which\" to see if it's a builtin or a func: e.g. \"which grep\" --> /usr/bin/grep means it's a program/binary file, not a builtin) fun fact: which is a binary file/program, not a builtin \"alias\" is a powerful tool for creating shortcuts to commands: e.g. \"alias python='python3'\" --> means that when I type \"python\", it'll open python3 for me \"typeset\" and \"declare\" have the same functionality, typeset is just obsolete Spent the day trying to containerize an old app/game I made. I learned that a library (Playsound) I used is very poorly maintained. I might need to give up or refactor the app with a different library. Currently, Playsound won't work in virtual envs (like Docker) because of the Gi module. Spent the day going through git tutorials. Learned about rebasing vs merging (basic, I know) from a very cool resource (https://learngitbranching.js.org/). Hopefully, also managed to fix the issue that my PR caused on the BBT repo for 100 Days.","title":"docs/Los.md"},{"location":"dylan%21/","text":"100 Days of code a personal log by dylan!
