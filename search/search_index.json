FAQ: What Is The #100daysOfCode Challenge? 100 Days Of Code is a social media project, primarily on Twitter, that anyone can participate in via the #100daysOfCode hashtag. Developer Alex Kallaway started it in 2016 based on the idea that consistency is the path to mastery. Plus, the hashtag fosters a sense of community\u2014you can use it to see where others are at in their journey and to stay motivated to document your own. How Can I Participate? Do #100daysOfCode with the Baltimore Black Techies! Work your way through projects, or document your Tech journey\u2014either way, posting what you\u2019re learning each day is a great way to see your coding progress unfold and find support.

Built the game Pong in Python to touch up on my Python skills again. Revisted turtles, tkinter, and Docker. *Learned that: Python not being a compiled language means I'll frequently run into issues with missing libs/pckgs when containerizing/working in virt envs About the Turtle library and how it relates to tkinter Adding sound in Python is very complicated because it's handled differently by each OS (damn you capitalism) Continued building off my pong game. What I did: Added a speed multiplier to the ball. Added the ability to pass along player names. Added randomization of ball projectory at start of each round. Points of pain: Still can't properly containerize the game due to an issue with tkinter/screen access in Docker Starting to think containerizing anything that isn't vanilla Python isn't worth it Worked on the next chapter of Learn Bash The Hard Way. What I learned: You don't need quotes to declare a string var: e.g. MYSTRING=astring echo $MYSTRING --> astring Single quotes for vars means you don't actually call the var: e.g. MYSENTENCE='A sentence with MYSTRING in it' echo MYSENTENCE --> A sentence with $MYSTRING in it This is not true for globs ( ): e.g. MYGLOB=\" \" echo $MYGLOB --> Everything in my current directory When indexing arrays: I need curly brackets around the whole variable and index But the still goes outside of the whole declaration: e.g. {BASH_VERSINFO[0]} All simple vars in bash are really arrays with just 1 element in it Commas are one way to iterate through an array: e.g. echo ${BASH_VERSINFO[0,5]} --> x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (returns elements 0-5) Associative arrays are like dicts but look very messy; should prob avoid them Continued Learn Bash The Hard Way to cover functions. What I learned: vars have a global scope unless otherwise declared to declare limited scope, use \"local\": e.g. function myfunc { local myvar=\"Hi from inside the function\" echo myvar } --> if I call myvar outside the function, it won't work because it only exists inside the function \u201c cd - \u201d returns you to the previous directory you were in use \"builtin\" to call functions built into Bash Useful incase you make a function that conflicts in name with a builtin (like \"func cd()\") With clashes, the function, not builtin is used Use \"unset -f name_of_func\" to unset func name & remove the conflict (or \"-v\" to unset vars) \"declare -f\" outputs all funcs in my env (including their code) while \"declare -F\" just lists the funcs names Programs are executable files (think grep, vi, sed, etc) you can use \"which\" to see if it's a builtin or a func: e.g. \"which grep\" --> /usr/bin/grep means it's a program/binary file, not a builtin) fun fact: which is a binary file/program, not a builtin \"alias\" is a powerful tool for creating shortcuts to commands: e.g. \"alias python='python3'\" --> means that when I type \"python\", it'll open python3 for me \"typeset\" and \"declare\" have the same functionality, typeset is just obsolete Spent the day trying to containerize an old app/game I made. I learned that a library (Playsound) I used is very poorly maintained. I might need to give up or refactor the app with a different library. Currently, Playsound won't work in virtual envs (like Docker) because of the Gi module. Spent the day going through git tutorials. Learned about rebasing vs merging (basic, I know) from a very cool resource (https://learngitbranching.js.org/). Hopefully, also managed to fix the issue that my PR caused on the BBT repo for 100 Days. Continued Learn Bash The Hard Way to cover functions. What I learned: Learned about the channels Std Error and Std Output If you string cmds (e.g. cat file | grep -c file ), if the first cmd outputs to Std Err, nothing is passed to the pipe cmd in this case /dev/null is a special file created by Linux (and UNIX) kernels that's black hole into which data can be pumped; anything written to it will be absorbed and ignored. The < operator redirects standard input to the command from a file e.g. grep -c file < file1 will pass file1 as input to the cmd grep Using > will overwrite a file; using >> will append to it e.g. echo line2 > file3 echo line3 >> file3 --> cat file3 file3 | | --> line2 line3 Continued Learn Bash The Hard Way to cover scripts. What I learned: A pipe passes \u2018standard output\u2019 as the \u2018standard input\u2019 to another command A redirect sends a channel of output to a file The < operator redirects standard input to the command from a file How to set permissions using chmod Continued Learn Bash The Hard Way to continue scripts and tests. What I learned: You can't use '' to substitute commands in a script, you need \"\" (e.g. '$(hostname)' won't work) You can use ticks though (e.g. \"hi hostname \" --> hi WayneTech-IdeaPad)' You can nest commands like this: (cmd1 (cmd2 $(cmd3))) Overall, () is easier to nest and read than ` because you have to escape \\ with backslashes $? can tell you if the last command failed (1) or not (0) \"[\" is a builtin and a program and \"[\" and \"test\" are synonymous You can write \"and\" and \"or\" as ||/-o and &&/-a respectively (e.g. [ 1 = 1 -o ! '0' = '0' -a '2' = '2' ])) Use [[ as a safety net to tolerate cmds that don't exist (e.g. [[ ${DOESNOTEXIST} = '' ]] is evaluated as [ '' = '' ]) It's prob for the best to always use [[ to just be safe Continued Learn Bash The Hard Way to continue scripts, conditionals, tests, unary and binary operators. What I learned: I should probably use [[ always because it's such a good safety net (e.g. [ 10 < 2 ] doesn't work but [[ 10 < 2 ]] does because the former has < expecting a STRING, not int) From the above, this means that type matters in bash so all the more reason to use [[ However things like -gt, -lt, -eq, -ne all work fine with a single [ You can make a single line script and use semi's to show new lines (e.g. if [[ 10 -lt 2 ]]; then echo 'does not compute'; fi )","title":"docs/Los.md"},{"location":"dylan%21/","text":"100 Days of code a personal log by dylan!
